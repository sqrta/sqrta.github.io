Wellcome to Haowei Deng's homepage

Bio
======
I am a Ph.d student in at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.umd.edu/), University of Maryland, College Park from 2020 Aug. I was also affiliated with the [Joint Center for Quantum Information and Computer Science](https://quics.umd.edu/). I was advised by Prof. [Xiaodi Wu](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~xwu/). My research focuses on quantum program synthesis, quantum circuit optimization and quantum error correction code search.

In 2020, I received a Bachelor of Engineering from the [Institute for Computer Science](https://en.cs.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm), University of Science and Technology of China.
